# 8 Integration

Most of the time we are not starting a new app, we just want to use react-native to develop some new features, so integration should be a necessary skill for react-native developers.

Assume that you have create some features in the AwesomeProject, you want to create an exactly same environment for your current project.

**Notice that** version is very important after your app published. If you want to upgrade react-native and package codes, that almost means you don't want to maintain the old version any longer.
